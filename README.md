# bwaves
brave waves css background, made for dark mode (if you want the light mode waves just check commit history)

just link `braves.css` and add

```html
  <div class="topwaves"></div>
  <div class="waves"></div>
```

to body

make sure to add overflow hidden to the waves parent because thats messed up for whatever reason
